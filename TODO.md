## üîÑ Current Status

**Theme switching should now work properly!** 

The issues were:
1. **Hardcoded dark background styles** overriding the theme system
2. **Hardcoded light text colors** making text invisible in light theme

Both issues have been resolved, and now the components should properly respond to theme changes.

## üß™ Testing Instructions

1. **Open the login page**: http://localhost:3000/login
2. **Log in with demo account**: admin@hotel.com / admin123
3. **Navigate to dashboard**: Should now show proper light theme with visible text
4. **Test theme toggle**: Click the sun/moon icon in the top navbar
5. **Verify light theme**: 
   - Background should be light
   - "Hotel Management" title should be clearly visible in dark text
   - Subtitle should be visible in medium gray text
   - All other text should be properly visible

## üéØ Expected Results

- **Light Theme**: Light background with dark text (fully visible)
- **Dark Theme**: Dark background with light text
- **Theme Toggle**: Should switch between themes instantly
- **No More Hardcoded Styles**: All components should respect theme selection
- **Text Visibility**: All text should be clearly visible in both themes

## üìù Notes

- All hardcoded background colors have been removed
- All hardcoded text colors have been replaced with theme-aware classes
- Components now use proper Tailwind classes like `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`
- Theme system is fully functional with CSS variables
- No more `!important` overrides blocking theme changes
